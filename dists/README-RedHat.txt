       How to build pastash rpm ot of this pastash.spec in order to 
       install it on the RedHat based Linux OS.
      ========================================================================

Read this document through entirely before star building your rpm package.

  1. 
  Read the main documantation page
https://github.com/sipcapture/pastash/blob/master/README.md
 - follow through the steps of "Installation" chapter, except ZeroMQ. I've built my .rpm against newer ZeroMQ library v3.2.5,
and the 'pastash.spec' is configured this way. Then do NOT do 'yum install zeromq zeromq-devel', instead of this 
enable EPEL repo, i.e.
rpm -Uvh --replacepkgs http://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/6/x86_64/epel-release-6-8.noarch.rpm
  - the latest ZeroMQ lib within EPEL is v3.2.5 (as per April 2015), so do:
yum install zeromq3 zeromq3-devel
 ...Btw, the latest source version is v4 already, so if you want the latest - do your own workaround, 
BUT then keep in mind, you will need to adjust the 'pastash.spec'  accordingly.

  2. 
  Follow this document to setup your rpmbuild environment
https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/How_to_create_an_RPM_package
OR
  being non-root and while staying inside the directory where you're reading this manual, copy the whole tree to your home dir:
cp -r ./rpmbuild  ~/
  then copy the settings
cp ./rpmbuild/.rpmmacros  ~/

Here is the file checklist, so far you must have:
~/.rpmmacros

~/rpmbuild/
    BUILD
    BUILDROOT
    RPMS
    SOURCES
    SPECS
    SRPMS

~/rpmbuild/SOURCES/
    logstash
    run_node.sh
      - these are the RHEL-customized scripts to start 'logstash' as a service.

~/rpmbuild/SPECS/pastash.spec

  3. 
  Check for the latest version of NodeJS ( https://nodejs.org/ ), by the time of writing this document it is v0.12.2,
so if there is newer version, then edit to adjust the settings inside ~/rpmbuild/SPECS/pastash.spec

  4.
  An important dependency is 'start-stop-daemon' utility which exists in Debian/Ubuntu repositories. 
But there is no such a package in the EPEL/CentOS repositories. The 'pastash' is not written to fork in the background, 
that why we need this special tool.  I was trying to solve this problem using 'nohup' and '/etc/rc.d/init.d/functions', 
but it is rather headache and waste of time. Fortunately there is a 3rd party port of the 'start-stop-daemon' tool, 
you can obtain the source here in a form of .src.rpm  which makes things even much easier: 
wget ftp://ftp.pbone.net/mirror/ftp5.gwdg.de/pub/opensuse/repositories/home%3A/sschapiro%3A/openstack%3A/IS24/RedHat_RHEL-6/src/start-stop-daemon-1.9.18-2.2.src.rpm
  then
rpm -i start-stop-daemon-1.9.18-2.2.src.rpm
  - if your rpmbuild setup was correct, then you'll see 'start-stop-daemon.spec' inside ~/rpmbuild/SPECS
cd ~/rpmbuild/SPECS
rpmbuild -bb start-stop-daemon.spec
  - this program is a small nice piece of C code, so you'll have your 'start-stop-daemon-1.9.18-2.2.x86_64.rpm' 
and 'start-stop-daemon-debuginfo-1.9.18-2.2.x86_64.rpm' in less that a minute of building.

  5. 
cd ~/rpmbuild/SPECS
rpmbuild -bb pastash.spec
  - depending on your hardware it can take ~10 min  to build then you'll finally have pastash-0.0.3-1.el6.x86_64.rpm  package.

  6.
  Finally,
to deploy 'pastash' package on your RHEL or CentOS  machines you need:
 - enable EPEL repo then
yum install zeromq3
 - copy over then  install the following
rpm -i start-stop-daemon-1.9.18-2.2.x86_64.rpm
rpm -i pastash-0.0.3-1.el6.x86_64.rpm
  Do your config file then place it inside /etc/logstash.d/, then
/etc/init.d/logstash  start

p.s.  Use Ansible or salt-stack or Puppet etc to automate your installation tasks for big clusters.

   That is really it. :)
   Good luck.
